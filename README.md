This game aims to bring me and my brother closer together. Over the years, my brother has developed a passion for games that I also shared when I was a child. However, due to the age difference, we rarely or almost never have matching schedules. When he's at school, I'm working. When I'm free, he's studying. When I'm studying, he's free. Because of this, I decided to make my studies include this shared passion: developing a game using Next.

The game follows the same concept as the snake game: you need to eat to grow.

ðŸŽ® Throughout the game, there will always be at least one block on the screen. You need to collide with them to eat them.<br>
ðŸŽ® Each block you eat increases your body by 1 block.<br>
ðŸŽ® You lose the game if you touch your own body.<br>
